# Filter-design-N-th-order-Band-stop-discrete-filter-
Digital Signal Processing in Mathlab, the design of a discrete n-th order Band stop filter :: To find the highest order b coefficient 



This mathlab code makes use of the "Signal Processing toolbox", learn more about this toolbox here: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/signal/index.html?s_tid=CRUX_lftnav
We use the "fir1" function for filter design. 

To find out if you have this toolbox installed type "help fir1" into the command window. 
The format of the fir1 function is:: fir1( n-th order, cut off frequencies  , type_of_filter)
